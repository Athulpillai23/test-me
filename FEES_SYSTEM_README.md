# Comprehensive Student Fees Management System

This document provides a complete guide to the integrated fees management system for the Virtual Academy school management project.

## 🎯 Overview

The fees management system provides three distinct interfaces for different user roles:

1. **Admin Panel** - Manage all student payments and view comprehensive reports
2. **Owner Panel** - Verify cash collections, edit total fees, and view payment summaries
3. **Student Panel** - View personal payment history and access UPI payment options

## 🗄️ Database Changes

### Required Database Alterations

Run the following SQL commands to set up the database:

```sql
-- 1. Add fees column to students table
ALTER TABLE `students` ADD COLUMN `fees` DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00 AFTER `state`;

-- 2. Drop existing fee_record table and recreate with new structure
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `fee_record`;

CREATE TABLE `fee_record` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `student_id` varchar(40) NOT NULL,
  `amount` DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  `payment_date` DATE NOT NULL,
  `payment_mode` ENUM('cash', 'upi', 'cheque') NOT NULL,
  `collected_by_owner` BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  `timestamp` datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp(),
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `student_id` (`student_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

-- 3. Add sample data for testing
INSERT INTO `fee_record` (`student_id`, `amount`, `payment_date`, `payment_mode`, `collected_by_owner`) VALUES
('S1746314678', 5000.00, '2025-01-15', 'cash', FALSE),
('S1746314845', 3000.00, '2025-01-20', 'upi', TRUE),
('S1746315055', 2500.00, '2025-01-25', 'cheque', FALSE),
('S1746315238', 4000.00, '2025-02-01', 'cash', TRUE),
('S1746315403', 3500.00, '2025-02-05', 'upi', FALSE);

-- 4. Update some students with sample fees
UPDATE `students` SET `fees` = 20000.00 WHERE `id` = 'S1746314678';
UPDATE `students` SET `fees` = 25000.00 WHERE `id` = 'S1746314845';
UPDATE `students` SET `fees` = 22000.00 WHERE `id` = 'S1746315055';
UPDATE `students` SET `fees` = 28000.00 WHERE `id` = 'S1746315238';
UPDATE `students` SET `fees` = 30000.00 WHERE `id` = 'S1746315403';
```
